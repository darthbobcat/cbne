          <p>
            We offer low cost computers to concession card holders (pensioner, disability, and low income), students, and not for profit community groups. Our goal is to help cross the digital and economic divide in Australia. Our computers are all refurbished from
            donated stock. We are a licensed Microsoft refurbisher, and we offer either Microsoft Windows 10, or the free Ubuntu operating system. All our machines come internet ready. All machines come with your choice of the Microsoft Office Suite,
            or the free Libreoffice.

          <p>
            Our standard desktop system costs $100 ($110 with Microsoft Office Suite). It comes with the following hardware at a minimum:

          <ul>
            <li>Dual core processor</li>

            <li>DVD Drive</li>
            <li>Keyboard, mouse, and LCD Screen</li>
            <li>Your choice of Windows 10 or Ubuntu LTS</li>
            <li>Microsoft Office Suite (Additional cost of $10) or the free Libreoffice suite</li>

            We are usually able to offer laptop systems. Like the Desktop systems, these come with either Windows 10 or Ubuntu LTS. They also come with MS Office Suite or Libreoffice preinstalled. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee minimum specifications. We are able
            to guarantee that each laptop is configured to run responsively and will be fit for service.

We help provide computers to disadvantaged groups and individuals at a price that is affordable. We also help to reduce the amount of e-waste that makes it's way into landfill.

          This was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts, as a mere senile wandering in the narrative. "Our food-getters were called freemen. This was a joke. We of the ruling classes owned all the land, all the machines, everything. These
          food-getters were our slaves. We took almost all the food they got, and left them a little so that they might eat, and work, and get us more food&mdash;" "I'd have gone into the forest and got food for myself," Hare-Lip announced; "and if

          "I am--I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story." So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale. "I was born
          in Omaha--" "Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy. "No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her sadly. "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master.
