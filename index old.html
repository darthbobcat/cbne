            We offer low cost computers to concession card holders (pensioner, disability, and low income), students, and not for profit community groups. Our goal is to help cross the digital and economic divide in Australia. Our computers are all refurbished from
            donated stock. We are a licensed Microsoft refurbisher, and we offer either Microsoft Windows 10, or the free Ubuntu operating system. All our machines come internet ready. All machines come with your choice of the Microsoft Office Suite,
            or the free Libreoffice.

              We are usually able to offer laptop systems. Like the Desktop systems, these come with either Windows 10 or Ubuntu LTS. They also come with MS Office Suite or Libreoffice preinstalled. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee minimum specifications. We are able
              to guarantee that each laptop is configured to run responsively and will be fit for service.

            "I am--I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story." So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale. "I was born
