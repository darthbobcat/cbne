          <p>
            We offer low cost computers to concession card holders (pensioner, disability, and low income), students, and not for profit community groups. Our goal is to help cross the digital and economic divide in Australia. Our computers are all
            refurbished from
            donated stock. We are a licensed Microsoft refurbisher, and we offer either Microsoft Windows 10, or the free Ubuntu operating system. All our machines come internet ready. All machines come with your choice of the Microsoft Office
            Suite,
            or the free Libreoffice.

          <p>
            Our standard desktop system costs $100 ($110 with Microsoft Office Suite). It comes with the following hardware at a minimum:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dual core processor</li>
            <li>2 GB of RAM</li>

            <li>DVD Drive</li>
            <li>Keyboard, mouse, and LCD Screen</li>
            <li>Your choice of Windows 10 or Ubuntu LTS</li>
            <li>Microsoft Office Suite (Additional cost of $10) or the free Libreoffice suite</li>

            We are usually able to offer laptop systems. Like the Desktop systems, these come with either Windows 10 or Ubuntu LTS. They also come with MS Office Suite or Libreoffice preinstalled. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee minimum
            specifications. We are able
            to guarantee that each laptop is configured to run responsively and will be fit for service.

          Started in June 2002, we are a fully volunteer staffed registered not for profit association. Our mission is two fold. We help provide computers to disadvantaged groups and individuals at a price that is affordable. We also help to reduce
          the amount of
          e-waste that makes it's way into landfill.
